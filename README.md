# COVID-19.JHU.Data

This repository is to analyze data from the John Hopkins COVID-19 dataset that is updated daily on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university). I will create a blog post about my analysis of the dataset on Medium for project 1 of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program through udacity.com.
